🏗️ Project Workflow

1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Before starting the analysis, the data underwent a thorough cleaning process:

Removing Unnecessary Columns: Dropped irrelevant columns like Status and unnamed1.

Handling Null Values: Identified and removed rows with null values, particularly in the Amount column, to ensure data integrity.
